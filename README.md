angucomplete-keyvalue
=====================

An AngularJS directive to provide input autocompletion in key="value" format. Based on https://github.com/darylrowland/angucomplete.

###Features
* Autocomplets keys and values independently.
* Value autocompletion is optional - some keys may have it and some may not.
* Multiple key="value" pairs can be added, separated with a semicolon.

## Limitations
* Only last item (be it a key or a value) in the string is autocompleted.
* Lacks many features of the original angucomplete (images, descriptions, etc.).
